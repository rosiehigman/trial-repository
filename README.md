# Data Champions ideas
Could we use GitHub for the Data Champions?
Advantages:
* Several DCs already using
* public so fits in with the open ethos
* Easier to involve external people
* Less ugly than Moodle
Disadvantages:
* Steep learning curve for people whoâ€™ve not used it before
* Possible barrier to those in the AHSS
* Unnecessarily complex?
